ROMANCE SHORT STORIE

<h2>Waiting  <br/>
<i>by Hellen Nyana</i></h2>
<p>The chick in the purple top, high waist skirt
 and kitten heels definitely knows how to dress 
 in an understated yet alluring sort of way. 
 Not a hair out of place - I had to stop and stare 
 to make sure there really wasn’t a hair out of place 
 - subtle make-up and clean, short, fingernails. 
 The fastened buttons of her button-down shirt 
 stop slightly above her bosom, giving me an ever
 so slight peep as she heaves in subtle anticipation. 
 She is a snob though. Earlier on, when I tried to 
 greet her and introduce myself, she had politely 
 answered, but had deliberately refused to give me her name,
 walking off instead and sitting at the other end of the table 
 where she pretends to read a book. No one can 
 convince me they can concentrate on a book while
 they wait for a life-altering experience so she has to be pretending.
 Then there is the breast-feeding chick.
 Not that she has come with a child to the job interview,
 but the tight knot around her chest attracts even more 
 attention to the already lifted boobs, thanks to 
 an obviously effective push-up bra. She keeps checking 
 herself in her pocket mirror and adding layers and layers
 of grease to her lips. She might be bored, like all of us
 are in the waiting room but she definitely intends to rely 
 heavily on her “bosom buddies” to nail the job. Those boobs
 better do a good job today or I would hate to think what she
 will do to them if they fail her, I think to myself. 
 I turn to my HTC and update my twitter status to: 
 Had I known boobs played a big role in getting a job,
 I would have been born a woman. #WinningNot</p>
 <p> The waiting room is down a long corridor, next
 to a conference hall with a big wooden door in which
 the written and oral interviews are to take place. 
 The room is portioned off with a glass screen and a sliding door.
 The glass has patterns on it, such that the people on the inside
 and those on the outside can see figures on either 
 side without making out the faces. It is furnished 
 quite tastefully with black sofas and a glass-top 
 table in the room’s centre, topped with business 
 magazines and profile pamphlets on the organisation
 conducting the interviews - the Ministry. Six of us
 have just been herded into the room from the reception.
 We mumble greetings to the people who are next to us in
 the line and attempt to look for comfortable spots in the
 room which can easily fit twenty people. I take the seat
 nearest to the entrance just in case I need to dash out,
 and also it can’t hurt to see all the people that want the job<p/>.

<p>The profile pamphlets are the first to be picked up and like hot, meaty bites at a cocktail party, they go fast. One must know everything they can about the company they want to work for, I guess. I pick one from the last two and begin to leaf through.   My reading is interrupted when a short, old man in an oversized coat sweeps into the room. He says in a firm and loud voice, “Good morning everybody. How are you all today?” We all mumble unintelligible things, some of us startled out of our private worlds by his commanding presence. Due to his air of authority, if I had not seen him before at the written interview we had in Namboole, I would have thought he already worked for the Ministry and had come to instruct us in the next step of the selection process. He goes ahead and pumps some hands, sprinkling more pleasantries as he jumps over people to reach those seated on the other side of the table. They have already warmed up their seats and refuse to leave their strategic vantage points. He finds a seat on the other side of the table which is directly opposite the entrance and proceeds to pull out a bunch of papers and starts going over them with furious concentration, as if preparing for a final exam. From the unnaturally black edges on his scalp, you can tell he has recently dyed his hair. Dude, you 
31  
should have cut off that beard completely because those grey hairs are not helping in your mission to look young, I mentally chastise the short, old man in an oversized coat.  </p>

  When he looks up from his papers, he seems to recognise the 
  chick that has come in after him and has chosen to sit next to me.
  Through their conversation later, I find out her name is Lydia.
  She takes a seat and goes through the newspaper she carried in with her.
  She mumbles comments about the day’s headlines and makes fun of 
  a photograph showing a smiling bank executive handing toys to a malnourished child.
  The emaciated body had made the front page the previous week.  
  “Corporate Social Responsibility, my foot!” she grumbles.   
  She looks up, her gaze meeting the short, 
  old man in an oversized coat who has now moved from his seat.</p>

<p>“You made it to this round I see,” he says while enthusiastically shaking her hand and looking around as if to make sure the rest of us have heard.   “So did you,” she says smiling, “How have you been, Mzee? We should stop meeting like this,” she adds removing her bag from the next seat and offering it to him instead.   He sits down next to her and the two start to catch up. From their conversation, I can tell they have met several times in different companies, always being interviewed for one job or another.   “No. We didn’t stand a chance at that Parliament job. Did you see the pile of letters where our application letters were thrown?” He asks rhetorically. “I bet if we tried to find out who the current editor of the Hansard is, it is definitely someone who already knew someone there,” he adds with a defeated shrug.   The old man goes into a tirade about how he would have given up the whole job search had it not been for the children he has to put through school. What is turning into a pity party is broken up when one of the interviewers enters and announces that the next interview is due soon and we need to move to the conference room next door. Two other people stand at the door panting and checking their watches. Written all over their faces is the relief that they’ve managed to make it to the next round. We shuffle to the next room, take our seats and get ready for our second written interview.   </p>
<p>He goes on to talk about his group of people as the smart and the
 lucky and how they had scrambled to the one shelter their former rulers left and taken it over. 
 The metaphor here is very powerful and it really makes it clear the point Achebe is trying to explain.
 The point is that a person who goes from having nothing (Nanga) 
 to having everything is going to be more reluctant to go back 
 to having nothing compared to someone that has had everything the whole time, 
 thus making him more greedy to gain power and more defensive against giving up this power.
 Odili emphasizes that the new nation was never indoors,
 but together in the rain, and they desprately needed to experience a little shelter.   </p>

“There has been a natural disaster in one of the rural constituents 
which has claimed ten lives and left hundreds of families displaced.
 Write a speech for the Minister of Disaster Preparedness which he 
 will deliver when he goes to sympathise with the survivors”. </p>

<p> That is our first question.   This question, 
instead of arousing panic or excitement, reminds me 
of my father. He always says I’m good with words and
 it is because of him I am here. The first time he 
 told me to get in touch with his friend at the 
 Ministry for a communications officer’s job, 
 I said no straight out. I had just come back
 from one of the best technology universities 
 in Malaysia where I did a Bachelor of Arts in
 games art development and I wasn’t going to 
 waste my time being whatever my father suggested.
 People always frowned at the kind of course I did,
 many questioning its marketability in a third world country, 
 but how are we going to become less third world, if we don’t
 introduce some of the things we see and learned in the first world?
 And why can’t third world students study subjects they are passionate
 about, instead of what their country’s limited job markets force them to do?   .</p>

<p>  I clearly remember the day my passion for video games started. I was six years old and my father had just returned from a trip abroad and he presented me with a Super Mario Bros game. He had planned to get me a toy car, but when he saw his American friend pick up the grey, rectangular cartridge for his son at the store, he decided to get the game for me instead. He did not know how 
32  
to operate it so I had to teach myself, my mother
 swears they did not see me for a week. 
 I could never refute that accusation considering 
 that video game became my best friend and incited
 my passionate love affair with video games. 
 Every time my father went on a trip I asked 
 that he bring me not the trendiest clothes,
 but the latest video games. The Legend of Zelda,
 Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and Dragon 
 Warrior saw me through my tumultuous 
 teenage years, when I escaped into them, 
 trying to get over my crush on Crystal - 
 our next door neighbour or when I wanted 
 to impress Bella - the first girl who came
 over our house to visit when I was 17. 
 Later I graduated to Assassin’s Creed, 
 Black OPs, Battlefield 3 Online and Modern Warfare 3 and
 my love for gaming was pretty much sealed.   </p>
