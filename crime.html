<h2>A short history of South African crime fiction  <br/>
<i></i></h2>
<p>Despite the vibrancy of thriller and crime fiction elsewhere,
 not much has happened in SA crime fiction over the last five decades. 
 Until recently that is. This isn’t exactly surprising as the 
 cops have been more or less an invading army in the eyes of most
 of the citizenry since forever. Certainly, 
 come the apartheid state in the late 
 1940s no self-respecting writer was going to set up
 with a cop as the main protagonist of a series. 
It was akin to sleeping with the enemy.</p>
 <p> So to get round this, in the late 1950s, 
 a young woman named June Drummond (who died in June 2011) 
 found a way to enter the genre with a novel called 
 The Black Unicorn that used an amateur sleuth to 
 solve the mystery. Recent searches by academics have 
 found that Drummond’s novel was far from the first 
 crime novel in English to be published in SA. 
 Indeed there were a number of earlier titles that 
 could be included under the broad generic of ‘crime fiction’. 
 Interestingly, The Black Unicorn came just four years after a 
 popular magazine, Drum, that had a vibrant readership in the 
 townships, ran a series of short stories featuring a character
 called the Chief. The author, Arthur Maimane, was hugely 
 influenced by the US pulps and the stories were derivative but
 highly entertaining. Unfortunately they’ve never been collected 
 although there is one to be found in the Crime Beat archives<p/>.
<p>In Afrikaans crime fiction also took decades to reach maturity.
 During the 1950s there’d been cheaply printed novels featuring steak-loving,
 hat-wearing detectives investigating single murders. Often these stories 
 were set in small towns and tended more towards pulp fiction than noir.
 After that Afrikaans crime fiction all but disappeared during the height
 of the apartheid era. But there were some notable exceptions in the works
 of Chris Moolman and two novels by Harry Kalmer. Both authors were more 
 or less ignored by the critics, although, they built up individual cult followings.<p/>

In English the thriller side of the genre was taken up by, most notably, Wilbur Smith and Geoffrey Jenkins, during the 1960s but it was not until the end of that decade that a major figure emerged – James McClure with a novel called The Steam Pig. This book introduced two cops, Tromp Kramer and Mickey Zondi. They would feature in a series that spanned the 1970s, disappeared for the 1980s, and finally ended with a prequel in 1993, The Song Dog. McClure’s twosome have gone some way to setting a convention for SA writers: the clever underling Zondi, the unsubtle Tromp with his built-in racism. In fact the books were highly satiric yet only one was banned, The Sunday Hangman. McClure died in 2006, after spending most of his life in the UK in Oxford..  </p>
  
  
  
  <p>McClure’s absence during the 1980s was filled by a different sort of crime thriller, 
  a series written by Wessel Ebersohn, featuring a prison psychologist Yudel Gordon as 
  the protagonist. Ebersohn published five Gordon novels up to 1991. The 1990s, 
  however, were to see a number of changes, not least the change in the country 
  to a democracy with the 1994 general election that ended the apartheid state.
  Overnight, well, almost overnight, the cops became the good guys and our 
  literature started taking on a different perspective. But it takes some 
  time for a country to mature and give itself permission to write and 
  read escapist books, especially as we’d been used to writing and
  reading as an act of protest.

For the current crime thriller writers, the 1990s were significant 
because of a man called Deon Meyer. His novels first appeared in 
Afrikaans and made it to the top of Afrikaans best-seller lists.
 For the first time here were novels on a par with international 
 crime fiction as far as plot sophistication and literary prowess 
 were concerned. One of his novels, Orion (translated as Dead at Daybreak), was successfully transposed by Meyer into a television series – broadening his fan base and that of Afrikaans crime fiction. Meyer not only revolutionised Afrikaans literature but he was well translated into English and these books opened the genre to new voices. All the same it took a number of years – six in fact – before Meyer was joined on his lonely platform. In 2005 Richard Kunzmann published the first of his Harry Mason and Jacob Tshabalala series, Bloody Harvests, and Andrew Brown won the Sunday Times Fiction Prize for his Coldstream Lullaby – proving that a krimi could out-write the literary reputations. In 2011 the Sunday Times Fiction Prize was again won by a crime novel, Sifiso Mzobe’s Young Blood. Also new Afrikaans figures appeared: Francois Bloemhof, Piet Steyn, Quintus van der Merwe, Dirk Jordaan, Chanette Paul, and Karin Brynard with her influential Plaasmoord (translated into English as Weeping Waters) among them..</p>

<p>“You made it to this round I see,” he says while enthusiastically shaking her hand and looking around as if to make sure the rest of us have heard.   “So did you,” she says smiling, “How have you been, Mzee? We should stop meeting like this,” she adds removing her bag from the next seat and offering it to him instead.   He sits down next to her and the two start to catch up. From their conversation, I can tell they have met several times in different companies, always being interviewed for one job or another.   “No. We didn’t stand a chance at that Parliament job. Did you see the pile of letters where our application letters were thrown?” He asks rhetorically. “I bet if we tried to find out who the current editor of the Hansard is, it is definitely someone who already knew someone there,” he adds with a defeated shrug.   The old man goes into a tirade about how he would have given up the whole job search had it not been for the children he has to put through school. What is turning into a pity party is broken up when one of the interviewers enters and announces that the next interview is due soon and we need to move to the conference room next door. Two other people stand at the door panting and checking their watches. Written all over their faces is the relief that they’ve managed to make it to the next round. We shuffle to the next room,
 take our seats and get ready for our second written interview.   </p> 
<p>
As for the sort of topics that have engaged these writers, well, initially serial killers – or to put it in a broader perspective, crimes of deviancy – were the subjects of choice for both English and Afrikaans writers. Perhaps in this there was a desire to steer away from the political issues dominating a nation in transition although this attitude is changing. Social and political concerns are back on the agenda and the bad guys are now as likely to be politicians, business moguls, and figures of authority as perverts, drug dealers, serial killers and gangsters. And their crimes are as likely to be crimes of deviancy as trade in blood diamonds, abalone poaching, the international drugs trade, arms dealing, political corruption, business scams, scandals and fraud, private security, and the hijacking of buildings. Significantly, state crimes began to feature and forms of espionage fiction became apparent in some of Meyer’s books (Trackers being an obvious example) and also in the work of Trevor R Corbett, and the more literary foray into that territory by Carel van der Merwe with his novel, Shadow. If there is a forerunner to these novels it is Andrew Gray’s 2007, The Fence. Critics also began to suggest that crime novels could be seen as the new version of the political novel. Riding well out in the front as a major issue is the ineffectiveness of due process and the satisfaction of moral justice. But that’s a major theme anywhere in the world. And it’s also a truism applicable to South Africa that if you want to know the country read its crime fiction.
 You’ll get the low-down and enjoy the ride. </p>
