The Promise (The Way You Make Me Feel)
</h2>
<p> 
Terrence and I made a promise back in the 2nd grade: That we would be friends forever. And nothing else.
I remember how we promised each other too: we pinky-swore.
But you see all that changed the first day of high school. It was a really sunny day. The way only the first day of school should be. I was unusually cheerful.
Not only was it because going into high school made me one step closer to the true freedom of college but also, I was finally going to see Terrence after a whole three months of not seeing him. He was home!
I was sitting there at the kitchen table picking at my dry toast and scrambled eggs, too excited to eat. I was shaking and shivering too although my mom didn't have the the air blasting like she had the entire summer. Then there was the doorbell, "DING-DONG!!!"
"I'll get it!" I yelled upstairs. Stupidly, I opened the door without even looking through the little peephole at the top.
It wouldn't have helped much anyhow. Not for the surprise I was about to encounter. When I opened the door there stood before me a tall, handsome young carmel-skinned brother there on the steps. He had on blue jean shorts, a striped T-shirt, and a silver chain around his neck. And those eyes... I was confused for a second. Who was this standing at my door?
Then the dude cracked a goofy smile...Terrence. "Well don't just stand there! You gonna let me in?" I rolled my eyes and let him in.
"Hold on," I said, grabbing my overloaded book bag. Terrence nodded and waited patiently, admiring all of my mom's African antiques as if he hadn't been there hundreds of times before.
"Ready?" he asked after I had gotten my bag. I nodded, avoiding his eyes. "Yeah," I said heading for the stairs. "Bye Mom!"
Before I could even turn around back to Terrence, Mom came rushing down the stairs in her slippers and hair curlers, Daddy's old camera in hand.
"Oh wait, wait, wait!" she exclaimed. Both Terrence and I heaved a sigh. Mom always did this on the first day of school. Terrence would come to my house from his across the street and Mom would take a whole bunch of pictures of us. I used to kind of like it, that is until after the 4th grade. Then it just got embarrassing and humiliating.
"Hold on," she said, adjusting the lenses. The camera made a few clicking sounds and then Mom was ready.
"Now say 'HIGH SCHOOL'!" she exclaimed.
"Mom, c'mon now! We're gonna be late," I said, lying.
"Oh c'mon Natalie. Smile. You too Terrence."
Terrence bent down to my height politely. Wow, I had never noticed how much taller Terrence was then me. In the 8th grade we seemed to be the same height. I glanced at him and saw that his goofy smile was plastered onto his face.
"How's this Ms. Hamilton?" he asked, putting his long arm around me. I tingled now with not only embarrassment but something else. Something else I could not explain.
"That's just fine Terrence. Now on three. One, two, three..."
"HIGH SCHOOL!" Terrence and I muttered. Mom took about 10 more shots after that and all the while Terrence had his arm around me. It was weird.
"Okay Mom. Are we done?" I said when Mom finally took the camera away from her face. "Yes Natalie. Gosh. You'd think I was asking you to jump off the Sears Tower. And you looked so cute in your pictures. And Terrence I much say you looked FINE!"
I felt ready to puke. My mom just took it to a whole new level: hitting on my best friend.
Terrence gave me a look. "Thank you Ms. Hamilton," he said shyly. I grabbed Terrence's arm. "We gotta go now Mom. Bye," I said as I pulled Terrence out the door.
"Bye sweetie! Bye Terrence," she called after us. As soon as we were far enough away I let go of Terrence's arm and heaved a sigh of relief. "Dang, I thought we'd never get out of there," I said.
"Yeah, it seems like it gets worse every year."
"Tell me about it."
As we walked to school, Terrence told me all about his trip to his grandparents' place in Arkansas.
"You sure did...change," I said glancing at him once again. I punched his arm lightly. "Even got a little muscle," I said. laughing. Terrence laughed too.
"Well I should hope so. My uncle, he went down there too and he had me runnin' around all over that stupid farm. Do you know how hard it is to work on a farm? There's milking and..." I tuned Terrence out. Oh, I nodded every once in a while but really I wasn't listening to the words he was saying but his actual voice. I hadn't noticed until then his old, high, pitchy squeak had transformed over the summer to a sweet soulful, sexy baritone.
"Well?"
I came back to planet earth. "Well what?" I asked. Terrence shook his head in slight annoyance.
"I said do you think we'll have the same classes?"
I swallowed hard and shrugged. Get over him girl. Remember your promise...
I looked at Terrence. "But I sure hope so. We both got Honors so we should be good." There was an awkward silence for a few seconds. "So 'um...did you miss Chicago?" I asked him, breaking the silence. Terrence smiled a little. That had changed too. Boy, him getting those braces in the sixth grade sure had helped!
"Miss it? As soon as I got to Arkansas I was dying to get back here. The open air and everything they got in Arkansas is cool and all, but it isn't home, Chicago. This is where-"
I looked at my watch. It was 2 minutes to 7. "This is where we're gonna be late if we don't hurry up," I exclaimed cutting Terrence off. The two of us rushed down the cracked sidewalk. Cigarette butts and old leaves cracked under our feet.
We finally got to Du Sable High School just as a red Lexus with the bass too high passed by. I panted for air. "Haven't-run-that-fast-since-the-7th-grade," I said between breaths. Terrence laughed again, seemingly not tired. "I remember when you used to be the most athletic girl in out neighborhood. Remember that one summer when you almost beat that car on your bike?"
I smirked a little remembering how tired I had been afterward. "Yeah, I burned rubber! I had to get a new bike after that." We both laughed, remembering old times.
But as we got nearer to the school, our laughter ceased. Behind those big red doors is high school...the future. No turning back.
Terrence grabbed my hand. My whole body tingled again in a way I could not control.
"You ready?" Terrence asked, looking as nervous as I. This was no 2nd grade. I nodded slowly. He gave me a small smile.
"Yeah, I'm not ready either." We slowly climbed the empty stairs. It seemed like Terrence and I were the only people in the world.
One step
Two step
Three step...
Until we reached the final step. "Here we go," Terrence said, giving my hand a tight squeeze. He pushed the front door open and led us inside.<p/>
