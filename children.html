<h2>In the Plantatio <br/>
<i>by Oyet Sisto Ocen </i></h2>
<p>I still recall its sweetness when he gave it to us.
 Uncle Tom found us playing in the banana plantations. 
 We were searching for nsenene, the grasshopper which 
 appeared seasonally when it rained in our village. 
 We searched for them on the ground and in the folds of the banana leaves.
 The first time we tasted it was when aunt brought it back from Kampala, 
 “Nakato and Kato come and get some sweets,” she’d cried. 
 We were plucking the legs and wings off nsenene in the 
 backyard of our grass-thatched hut. The sweets were different colours.
 I unwrapped the white vuvera, polythene paper, from one and threw it in my mouth.
 I felt the sticky honey sweetness fill my mouth and I swallowed<p/>
 <p>We ran past Joe’s house to reach Katumba’s house so that he could taste the nsenene. Kato was panting. We wanted to tell Katumba the news quickly and run back home. Mummy didn’t want us playing with Katumba. She said he had bad manners;
 he liked playing with his male part in front of us.   <p/>
 <p>Uncle Tom came down that road. He waved, beckoning us to come over.
 We ran in his direction. We were already imagining what he might give us.
 When we reached his car, he pulled the sweets from the black vuvera and 
 gave it to us. We were very happy and we began eating the sweets immediately.
 He drove off and we ran after his car. He lowered his panel and gave 
 something to the men who were playing cards in the shade. He left them cheering, 
 ‘mukulu, mukulu, big man, big man.’ We kept on running after him until he
 disappeared down the village where we couldn’t see him. We stood there 
 watching the dust raised by his car. Katumba said the smell produced by
 the car was very nice and he felt like eating it with bread<p/>

 “Katumba, our aunt came from Kampala,” Kato told him,
 from the cool shade where he was seated. 
 He was plucking the wings and the legs of nsenene. 
 The wind was blowing the bananas leaves lightly, 
 swaying them from side to side. “She brought for us some sweet.”
 Katumba dropped the saucepan he was holding. Kato broke the sweet, 
 which looked like a small stone,
 into two halves with his teeth and gave one to Katumba, “Eat.”    <p/> 
 
 <p>They had been good friends in spite of mummy’s restriction. Katumba threw his half into his mouth. Then he opened his mouth, his lips moulded, formed to look like a hallway. He was missing two lower teeth which left a path for us to see his tongue rotating. It made us laugh.   “It’s sweet, like ripe banana,” said Katumba laughing. 
 “Yes, Aunt Janet said it makes children’s teeth grow,” said Kato <p/>
 <p>When Katumba heard this he started rubbing a small remnant of the 
 sweet on his pink gums which made us laugh more. 
 We ran through the long trail of the banana plantation which connected our home 
 with that of Katumba’s. It was owned by Mr. Mukasa the old man.
 He planted oranges and pawpaw trees at the side of his plantation.
 We always stole from his trees when we emptied our fruit trees. 
 Mummy didn’t encourage stealing so we only did it when she was away.   
 When we reached home, we found aunt was telling mummy about the city. 
 She told mummy that Uncle Tom’s business had made him one of the richest men in the city.
 He had so much money he could buy the whole village and its contents.  <p/>
 <p>That morning aunt brought out the metal she brought from the city.
 It was for piercing ears. Aunt insisted for our ears to be pierced so
 that we did not fall prey to child sacrifices. But daddy was against 
 the piercing of the boys’ ears, he said it made them look like rouges. 
 So aunt and mummy pierced my ears and not Kato’s. It was painful, 
 but aunt said when it heals, I would put on glittering earrings 
 which would dangle to my shoulders which would make me look beautiful <p/>

<p>When Katumba and Joe came home, we sneaked into Mr. Mukasa’s
 plantation to steal some pawpaw. After getting the pawpaw, 
 we ran to our backyard, where no one would see us. 
 The plantation was situated by the road which ran from our 
 village to the school we attended – it was the same road that
 aunt used to come from Kampala. In our playground, we would sit for hours competing with each other to see who could throw stones the furthest. Sometimes we would fight over something small. We would then reconvene in the same place. In the playground we would 
19  
dream of becoming somebody big in future. Kato dreamt of becoming president, Joe dreamt of becoming a driver, Katumba, the head teacher of our school. I too, dreamt of teaching in our school, I wanted to be a class mistress and wear transparent spectacles like Miss John our class teacher. </p>

 Katumba said the smell produced by the car was very 
 nice and he felt like eating it with bread.   
 When we were coming back from school the next day, 
 we followed the marks left by Uncle Tom’s car tyres.
 Katumba and I were on the right side, while Joe was on the left. 
 Kato didn’t come to school that day, he was not feeling well. 
 Mummy decided to leave him at home and went to tend the garden.
 We missed his company on our way back. But we kept on playing as usual.
 Reaching our backyard, Katumba saw something red mixed in with the sand.  
 “It’s blood,” he said.   “No, that is Mr. Mukasa’s pawpaw,” said Joe and we laughed. 
  “My mum has cooked chicken today,” I said. </p>
