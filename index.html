<h2>Children's Short Stories</h2>
<h3>In the Plantation by <i>Oyet Sisto Ocen</i>
</h3>
<hr/>  
Oyet Sisto Ocen   
I still recall its sweetness when he gave it to us. 
Uncle Tom found us playing in the banana plantations.
 We were searching for nsenene, the grasshopper which 
 appeared seasonally when it rained in our village.
 We searched for them on the ground and in the folds of the banana leaves.
 The first time we tasted it was when aunt brought it back from Kampala,
 “Nakato and Kato come and get some sweets,” she’d cried. 
 We were plucking the legs and wings off nsenene in the backyard of our grass-thatched hut. 
 The sweets were different colours. I unwrapped the white vuvera, polythene paper, 
 from one and threw it in my mouth. I felt the sticky honey sweetness fill my mouth and I swallowed.   .

<h2>Humor Short Stories</h2>
<h3>Aman of the people by <i>Chua Achebe</i></h3>
<hr/>
In A Man of the People
,Chief Nanga, is referred to by the narrator,
 Odili, as a man of the people, and the most
 approachable politician in the country.  
 He is the minister of culture and his speeches 
 to the public represent everything that 
 a politician should do and be.  But as 
 Odili tells the story, it becomes clear
 that Chief Nanga does not practice what he preaches.
 The money that is supposed to go towards helping his community 
he uses instead to build four-story buildings, which he rents out for his own profit.

<h2>Non-humor Short Stories</h2>
<H3>Hash Tag  <i> Davina Kawuma</i></H3>
<hr/>
Headphones edged with brio, bulging over skirted sofas. Sport is the new sex. Dogs versus coyotes on the tight end of the stereo. Hazard lights stitch footsubishis and TV chicken into seams of Nokia eleven hundred housing. In loose sprays, cracked for patches of grey I save English names one cocktail at a time. Tusky Big Brother Africa house mates sniff my lemon bracts. I’m middle middle-class with a chance of un|dress codes. Raglan sleeves, push-up bras, harem culottes, wine-glass heels and a backpack full of silence. I will never wear myself out trying to get rich

<i>by Chinua Achebe </i></h3>
<hr/>
Though Okonkwo is a respected leader in 
the Umuofia tribe of the Igbo people, he
 lives in fear of becoming his father – 
 a man known for his laziness and cowardice.
 Throughout his life, Okonkwo attempts to be his father’s polar opposite.
 From an early age, he builds his home and reputation as a precocious wrestler and hard-working farmer.
 Okonkwo’s

<h2>Romance Short Stories</h2>
<h3>Waiting 
<i>by Hellen Nyana</i></h3>
<hr/>
<p>The chick in the purple top, high waist skirt
 and kitten heels definitely knows how to dress 
 in an understated yet alluring sort of way. 
 Not a hair out of place - I had to stop and stare 
 to make sure there really wasn’t a hair out of place 
 - subtle make-up and clean, short, fingernails. 
 The fastened buttons of her button-down shirt 
 stop slightly above her bosom, giving me an ever
 so slight peep as she heaves in subtle anticipation. 
 She is a snob though. Earlier on, when I tried to 
 greet her and introduce myself, she had politely 
 answered, but had deliberately refused to give me her name,
 walking off instead and sitting at the other end of the table 
 where she pretends to read a book. No one can 
 convince me they can concentrate on a book while
 they wait for a life-altering experience so she has to be pretending
